# iNi-Antivirus

there is a simple GUI program to scanning malicious software with signature-based detection method. you can run this program at Windows or Linux properly.

this program uses two hash database, the first one we use malwarebazaar api and as backup we use <a href="https://github.com/aaryanrlondhe/Malware-Hash-Database">aaryanrlhonde's database <a>  then we make all six file into one named database.txt. so you can run this program with internet (matching hashes with malwarebazaar api) or without (matching hashes with aaryanrlondhe's database)


## update:
- auto delete file when detected as malware
- simple gui
  

## soon?
- performance optimization
- stop scanning without stop program
- add other method (behavior and heuristic analysis)
- give a choice to delete or quarantine malware
- hmmm, any suggestion?
